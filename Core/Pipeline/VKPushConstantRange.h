             * arenâ€™t descriptors though; they live outside of that system. Instead of having a piece of user-allocated
             * memory storage, push constant storage is ephemeral. When you bind a program pipeline, you are effectively
             * creating a few bytes of push constant storage memory. You can upload CPU data to this memory via 
             * vkCmdPushConstants. Rendering or dispatch commands issued after this function can read from this memory 
             * through push constant uniform values. No synchronization is needed, as vkCmdPushConstants effectively 
             * executes immediately (within the command buffer)
             * 
             * Note that, push constants are written in ranges. A important reason for that, is that you can have 
             * different push constants, at different ranges, in different stages. For example, you can reserve 64 bytes
             * (1 glm::mat4) size on the vertex shader, and then start the frag shader push constant from offset 64. This
             * way you would have different push constants on different stages
